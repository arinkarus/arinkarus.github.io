## Welcome to my portfolio: Arina Chemrukova
Hi. My name is Arina and I’d like to give you some background information about myself and goals I want to achieve.

## Some info about me

I study at Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.
My faculty is Computer Systems and Networks. While studying at university I’ve realized that I enjoy developing applications of different complicity in C# language. So that is the reason that I am attending C# online course. I am fond of learning new stuff that will help me to improve my programming skills and become more creative developer. I consider that information technoligies are changing very quickly so it is extremelly imporant to study a lot in order to move with the times. And I’m ready for it.

## HILIGHTS

- I have exprerience in developing web applications based on ASP .NET MVC and ASP .NET Core.
- I’d like to create a web application based on ASP .NET Core for backend and React+Redux for frontend for my diploma.
- I understand the importance of such work in the development process as testing and I always try to test my apps the proper way.
- Sometimes I am interested in solving some task so much that I forget to sleep and eat! Perhaps it could be my disadvantage :)
