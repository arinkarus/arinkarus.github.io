## Welcome to my portfolio: arinkarus
Hi. My name is Arina and I’d like to give you some background information about myself and goals I want to achieve.

## Some info about me
***
I study at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. My specialization is Computer Systems and Networks. While studying at the university I realized that I enjoy developing applications of different complexity in the C# language. This is the reason why I am attending the C# online course. I am fond of learning new things that will help me improve my programming skills and become a more creative developer. I consider that information technologies are progressing very quickly so it is extremely important to study a lot in order keep up with them, and I’m ready for it.

## HILIGHTS
***
* I have experience in developing web applications based on ASP .NET MVC and ASP .NET Core.
* I’d like to create a web application based on ASP .NET Core for backend and React+Redux for frontend for my university diploma project.
* I understand the importance of work such as testing in the development process and I always try to test my apps the proper way.
* Sometimes I am interested in solving some task so much that I forget to sleep and eat! Perhaps it could be my disadvantage :)

## INTERESTS
***
My personal interests include:
* Learning new things about different informational technologies. 
I’m also interested in building apps with concise UI.
* My big addiction is various TV Series and films.
* One more of my interests is creating bead crochet ropes from tiny Japanese beads. 
This work requires a lot of attention to details.
* I enjoy spending time with my friends. 
We especially like to attend new cafes and bars in Minsk.

## Recent projects
***
* Web app that helps a person to keep fit by providing a user interface for adding records to eating and training diaries.
* Web app which is written in the PHP language named “Masterskaya”. This is a website that can be used by craftsmen in order to demonstrate their handmade items.
* Simple app for one of labs I made in the university that can be used for creating deposit and credit for some bank client.
